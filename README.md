Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using Machine Learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of credit card transactions labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate to train a predictive model. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can automatically identify fraudulent transactions and alert the relevant authorities to take appropriate actions.

Workflow
1.Import Necessary Libraries: Start by mentioning all the essential libraries and packages used in the project. These may include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

2.Data Preprocessing: Explain the steps taken to preprocess the dataset before feeding it into the ML model. This could include handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provide an overview of the EDA process, highlighting any important patterns or insights gained from the data. Mention the plots and visualizations used to explore the data.

4.Train-Test Split: Describe how you divided the dataset into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting. Mention the ratio used for the split.

5.Model Training: Explain how you trained the Machine Learning model using logistic regression. Mention any specific hyperparameters or configurations used.

6.Model Evaluation: Describe the process of evaluating the model's performance, including calculating the accuracy score on the test set.

7.Confusion Matrix Visualization: Explain how you used seaborn to plot a heatmap of the confusion matrix. This visualization helps to understand the accuracy score and model performance better.
